/Make a list of vehicles, you can add "motorbike", "caravan", "bike", or more.

let vehicles = {
  vehicle1:"carvan",
  vehicle2:"bike",
  vehicle3:"motorbike",
  vehicle4:"car",
  vehicle5:"airplane"
}

//How do you get the third element from that list?

console.log(vehicles.vehicle3);


//Change the function vehicle to use the list of question 4. So that vehicle("green", 3, 1) prints "a green new caravan".

let c = "green"
let a = "new"
let b = vehicles.vehicle1

function vehicle(c, a, b){
    console.log("a " + c, a, b);
  return

vehicle(c, a, b)
vehicle("blue", "used", vehicles.vehicle2)
vehicle("red", "classic", vehicles.vehicle4)
